# Console A* Pathfinding
  
### Description :   
This project is my first experiment with the A* pathfinding algorithm.  

It's just a 2D grid where you have two points, A and B, and you can draw a line between them.  
Of course you can put obstacles between the two points.   
This will change the initial path and therefore the algorithm will again find the shortest path.  

I did not check but there are surely memory leaks in the program.
  
### What I learned : 
I understood how the A* algorithm works and how to use it.  

### Compilation :  
To compile the project you need to use a terminal and use :  
-> gcc -o prog.exe *.c  
  
### Specifications :  
This is a side project was made in C, on Windows (comments in French).
