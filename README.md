# Console_APathfinding  

First experiment with the A* Pathfinding.  

This project was made in C on Windows, it's just a 2D grid where you have two points and you can draw a line between them.  
Of course you can put obstacles between the two points.   
This will change the initial path and therefore the algorithm will again find the shortest path.

I did not check but there are surely memory leaks in the program.  
Project in French.  

To compile the project you need to use a terminal and use : "gcc -o prog.exe *.c".
